# The Odd Labs: Story & Lore

## The Mission
**The Odd Labs** was established to research the vast potential of cellular life. Scientists here dedicated their lives to engineering cells that could accelerate environmental healing and improve human health. For years, it was a place of hope and discovery.

## The Incident: "The Spiced Mutation"
Years ago, a mysterious "accident" occurred that changed everything. Overnight, the microscopic cells mutated into sentient, large-scale entities (reaching up to 15cm). While the staff and the public grew to love these helpful "Cells," **Director Capsain** turned against them, claiming they were unstable anomalies.

### The False Accident (The Cover-up)
To hide the truth, Director Capsain officially logged the event as **"The Ionization Leak of '82."** He claimed a faulty reactor shield allowed high-energy particles to bathe the petri dishes, causing "unforeseen genetic drift." This allowed him to blame aging equipment rather than his own actions.

### The True Plot Twist
The "Ionization Leak" never happened. While working late, Director Capsain accidentally dropped a generous amount of **"Inferno Chili Sauce"** into the central neutrophil immune cell dish while eating extra-spicy noodles.

In a state of pure panic, the Director watched as the first cell mutated into the **Origin Nitrophil**. Thinking it was the only one, he immediately hid it away in the Old Lab Room before anyone else arrived. In his haste to cover his tracks, he neglected to check the surrounding petri dishes. 

The next morning, to his horror and the staff's amazement, "normal" (yet surprisingly large) Nitrophils had blossomed from the remaining dishes that had been touched by the spicy fumes. 

## Key Characters & The Quest
To save the project and reveal the truth, the player must recover the **Origin Nitrophil**—the first spicy-mutated cell hidden away by the Director.

### The Three Keys of Proof
1.  **Lana (The Botanic Expert)**: Scientist working on **Cambihil**. Defeat her to receive the **Old Lab Room Key**.
2.  **Dyzes (The Human Cell Expert)**: Scientist working on **Lydrosome**. Defeat him to receive the **Location DataLog**.
3.  **Director Capsain**: The head of the lab. Defeat him to receive the **Rare Inferno Sauce**.

### Major NPC Profiles

- **Jenzi (Senior / Gatekeeper)**: The face of the Entrance Room. She's "Gen Z" to the core—mischievous, speaks in slang, and loves teasing interns. Despite her playful attitude, she's a highly skilled Senior with deep knowledge of the lab's inner workings. She guides the player and "validates" their findings.
- **Director Capsain**: The authoritarian head of The Odd Labs. He is grumpy, defensive about the '82 Leak, and values "professionalism" above all else. He publicly despises the sentient Cells as "monstrous anomalies," but secretly cares for the Origin Nitrophil and is deeply embarrassed by his noodle-related mistake.
- **Lana (Botanic Expert)**: A brilliant but impatient scientist. She is hardheaded and often snaps at the player for being inefficient. After being defeated, she seems to be holding something back, giving the player a key but warning them to mind their own business.
- **Dyzes (Human Cell Expert)**: Chill, laid-back, and eccentric. He believes in "cellular harmony." After his battle, he acts suspicious/hiding something, but provides the data needed to find the Old Lab.
## The Origin Nitrophil
The **Origin Nitrophil** is a secret known only to Director Capsain. Hidden in a dusty, unused corner of the lab, it is the Director's silent burden. It is significantly larger than its siblings, with a vibrant, glowing **Orange Chili Hue**. Surprisingly, it isn't aggressive; it's incredibly chill and hyperactive—a direct result of its high-potency capsicum origins.

## Progression: The DataLog System
The truth is hidden in the digital archives. Collecting DataLogs unlocks new sectors and reveals the real history of the Lab.

1.  **Lobby Start**: Talk to Jenzi -> Choose Cell -> **Test Battle** (Win or Lose) -> **Log #001** drops near Atrium door.
2.  **Atrium Unlock**: Collect Log #001 -> Talk to Jenzi -> Atrium door unlocks.
3.  **Lana's Sector (5 Logs)**: Collect 4 more logs in Atrium (Total 5) -> Talk to Jenzi (She tells the False Incident) -> Lana's Room unlocks.
4.  **Dyzes' Sector (10 Logs)**: Collect 5 logs in Lana's Room (Total 10) -> Battle Lana -> Receive Key -> Talk to Jenzi -> Dyzes' Room unlocks.
5.  **Director's Suite (15 Logs)**: Collect 5 logs in Dyzes' Room (Total 15) -> Battle Dyzes -> Receive Old Lab info -> Talk to Jenzi -> Director's Room unlocks.
6.  **The Climax (20 Logs)**: Find 5 logs in Director's Room (Total 20) -> Battle Director -> Receive Inferno Sauce -> Talk to Jenzi.

## NPC Dialogue Progression

Characters respond differently based on the number of DataLogs you have archived.

### Jenzi (Senior / Gatekeeper)
### Jenzi: The Induction
**Jenzi:** *"Welcome to the trenches, Intern! I'm Jenzi, and I'll be your guide through this corporate fever dream. We're supposedly 'healing the world,' but mostly we're just trying not to get fired by Capsain."*

**Jenzi:** *"Since you're the new main character, you need a Companion Cell. It's like a smart pet, but way more... liquid. It'll help you access the lab's tactical subnet and, you know, not die. Pick your favorite vibe."*

**Jenzi:** *"I've got three in the incubator. Don't overthink it, unless you're a Tryhard."*

- **Cambihil**: *"Tanky and green. Good for people who like to play safe and hide behind a shield of salad."*
- **Lydrosome**: *"High IQ and precise. It uses water pressure to snipe things. Very 'surgical' if you're into that."*
- **Nitrophil**: *"Pure chaos and fire. It's the 'hold my juice' of the lab. Aggressive af."*

**Jenzi:** *"Choose well, bestie. This cell is your new personality. Ready to lock it in?"*
- **After Pairing**: *"Sheesh, nice pick! Let's see if you can actually use it though. Bet you can't even touch me in a battle. Square up!"*
- **Post Test Battle**: *"Not bad, not bad. You actually have some skill. No cap. Oh look, someone's out here littering again. Pick up that Datapad next to the Atrium door. It's giving... 'lazy researcher' vibes."*
- **After Picking up Log #001**: *"Aha! Another lost Datapad. People here would forget their own heads if they weren't attached. Collect 'em and bring 'em to me, okay? I'll 'officially' return them to the owners. Door to the Atrium is open now. Go explore, but don't get lost in the sauce."*
- **Atrium Progression (5 Logs)**: *"You've been busy! 5 Datapads already? Lowkey impressive. Since you're actually doing work, I'll tell you the 'tea' about the Incident. Director says it was an 'Ionization Leak'. Major cap. But honestly, go ask Lana in the Botanic wing. She's the main character of that floor anyway. Door's open!"*
- **Lana Progression (10 Logs)**: *"Wait, Lana gave you a key? And she was acting sus? Sus-picious! That's weird af. Maybe things aren't as simple as 'spicy ozone'. You should totally go bother Dyzes in Human Research. He's chill, but he definitely knows things he's not saying."*
- **Dyzes Progression (15 Logs)**: *"Dyzes gave you info on an 'Old Lab'? Okay, now this is getting serious. No more jokes. You need to confront the final boss himself. Director Capsain. His room is open. Go get the truth, Intern."*
- **Director Progression (20 Logs)**: *"You beat the Director and got the Inferno Sauce? Main Character energy! You have all the clues now. Find that Old Lab Room. That's where the final secret is hidden."*

### Lana (Botanic Expert)
- **Normal (< 5 Logs)**: *"Hello there! Be careful not to step on the Cambihil spores. They're quite sensitive to heavy boots. Have you seen the Director? He was looking for a 'spicy' fertilizer earlier..."*
- **Flavor Lines (Anytime)**:
    - *"You're 14 seconds late for this conversation. Make it quick! It’s not like I was waiting for you or anything, I have nitrogen-cycles to monitor!"*
    - *"Your last research report was... acceptable. Barely. Don't look so happy, Intern, basic competency is the bare minimum!"*
    - *"Don't get used to me helping you. I just don't want an incompetent intern lowering the lab's safety rating. Now take this notes and leave!"*
    - *"Why are you still standing here? Efficiency isn't a suggestion! ...But, I suppose you haven't completely failed yet. Keep it up. Not that I'm cheering for you."*
    - *"Why are you staring? I was just... checking if your partner Cell was properly hydrated! Not because I'm worried about you! It’s a valuable lab asset, unlike Some People!"*
- **Boss (>= 5 Logs)**: *"Wait. You've been poking around the botanical archives, haven't you? Look, I love these cells, but the Director says we have to keep the research classified. If you want that Old Lab Key, you'll have to prove you can handle the truth in a duel!"*
- **Before Battle**: *"Archiving logs now, are we? You interns are so nosy! If you want to keep poking around, you'll have to go through me first! Prepare for a lesson in botanical efficiency!"*
- **Defeated**: *"Fine! You win! *[Mutters]* Just like the Director during the Leak... always so stubborn. Here, take this Old Lab Room Key. It's for some old storage room. Just... don't believe everything you read in the logs. "*

### Dyzes (Human Cell Expert)
- **Normal (< 10 Logs)**: *"Lydrosome is a marvel of tactical evolution. Its osmotic pressure allows for surgical precision—dissolving a single harmful enzyme without touching the surrounding tissue. It's the ultimate biological sniper."*
- **Flavor Lines (Anytime)**:
    - *"Hey. Breathe in that osmotic mist... feels like a fresh ocean breeze, right? Or maybe just distilled enzymes. Same thing, really."*
    - *"The Lydrosomes are in a good mood today. One of them actually waved at me. Or it was just a pressure vent. I'm choosing to believe it waved."*
    - *"Don't mind the hum. That's just the sound of cellular harmony. Or my fan. Honestly, I stopped checking."*
    - *"You ever wonder if we're just big cells in a giant lab called 'Earth'? Deep stuff, Intern. Real deep."*
    - *"Chill out. Stress increases cortisol, and cortisol ruins the data. Just let the flow take you."*
- **Boss (>= 10 Logs)**: *"I've seen your log activity. You're piecing together 'The Incident', aren't you? Capsain is a good man, just... proud. I can't let you expose him without a proper test of your tactical skill. Prepare yourself!"*
- **Before Battle**: *"You're looking for the 'Point Zero', aren't you? The flow of information is leading you to places Capsain wants kept in the dark. I'm chill, but I have to follow the chain of command. Let's see if your vibe is strong enough to break it."*
- **Defeated**: *"Woah, okay. Your tactical flow is elite. I can't really hide the truth if you're this good. The Old Lab exists, man. It's not on the main maps. Here's the coordinates I found. Capsain is just... he's protective, you know? Good luck."*

### Director Capsain
- **Normal (< 15 Logs)**: *"What are you doing here? These labs aren't for sightseeing! Get back to your station or I'll have you filing paperwork for a month. And ignore that smell, it's... experimental ozone."*
- **Flavor Lines (Anytime)**:
    - *"I don't pay you to wander the atrium. I pay you to contribute to a failing project. Wait, I don't pay interns at all. Even better—get back to work."*
    - *"There is a very specific protocol for handling sensitive materials. Step one: Don't touch anything. Step two: Refer to step one."*
    - *"Lana's greenhouse is taking up too much power. If it weren't for the board's interest in 'green tech', I'd have paved that wing for more reactor space."*
    - *"The smell? It’s industrial ionization. If you can’t handle a little stinging in the nostrils, you shouldn’t be in a lab."*
    - *"Stop asking about the '82 logs. The archives were purged for security reasons. Unless you have a level 5 clearance, it's none of your business."*
- **Boss (>= 15 Logs)**: *"So. You found the Noodle Review. You found the '82 security gap. You think a little chili sauce is enough to topple this Director? Fine. If you want the 'Origin', you'll have to go through me and my strongest Nitrophil first!"*
- **Before Battle**: *"So, the little investigator has finally reached my door. You've collected the trails of my 'mistakes'? This lab is my legacy, and I won't have it tarnished by some spicy gossip! Prepare to see why I'm the Director!"*
- **Defeated**: *"I... I failed? To an intern? *[Sighs deeply]* You've seen the logs. You have the sauce. You've basically already found out. Here, take this Rare Inferno Sauce... it's just a research sample! Nothing more! Now go away, I have... important papers to write."*

### Background Scientist Dialogue (Random NPCs)

These dialogue lines are randomly assigned to generic researchers based on the sector they are currently in. The `//` symbol indicates a manual page break in the dialogue window.

#### Zone: Lab Lobby (Entrance)
1. *"Welcome to Odd Labs!// Please keep your badge visible at all times and avoid the bio-hazard chutes."*
2. *"The Incubation Chamber is just ahead.// Have you picked your signature cell yet? Career paths depend on it!"*
3. *"Don't mind the security guards.// They're mostly here for... aesthetic compliance and to keep the cells in check."*
4. *"If you're looking for the Director, he's usually in the Executive Suite.// Or hiding in the cafeteria during 'Noodle Tuesday'."*
5. *"Stay sharp, Intern.// This lobby might look peaceful, but the research floors are quite the tactical maze."*
6. *"I'm heading to the breakroom.// Apparently, the coffee machine finally stopped dispensing blue sludge."*

#### Zone: Main Atrium (The Hub)
1. *"Have you seen the latest readings on the Nitrophils?// They seem to have a higher metabolic rate whenever it's Noodle Tuesday.// Strange correlation."*
2. *"The Director was shouting in the cafeteria again.// He called the Nitrophils 'bio-hazardous junk' and threatened to incinerate any dish with a red stain.// I've never seen someone so angry at a cell."*
3. *"I remember the Leak of '82... supposedly.// The Director still uses it as an excuse to ignore the Cells.// He calls them 'failed remnants of a dark day' whenever he's in a bad mood."*
4. *"The Cells are so helpful! One of them helped me reorganize my entire filing cabinet.// Although, it did categorize everything by 'color' instead of 'alphabetical'."*
5. *"Why is the vending machine always out of Spicy Peanuts?// I suspect the Director is buying the entire stock for his late-night shifts."*
6. *"Did you hear? A junior intern claims to have seen a 'giant' cell in the old storage wing.// Probably just lack of sleep and too many energy drinks."*
7. *"The new bio-blue interface is much easier on the eyes, don't you think?// It makes the whole lab feel more tactical and professional."*
8. *"I tried to pet a Nitrophil today.// It was remarkably soft, and it just stared at my lunch with such intense, spicy curiosity.// They're almost... cute."*
9. *"Did you know Lydrosomes can use their osmotic pressure to precisely target debris?// I saw one pressure-cleaning a set of microscopes in the breakroom yesterday. Not a speck of dust left."*
10. *"The Osmotic types are fascinating.// They can filter an entire liter of lab-grade water in under ten seconds.// We haven't had a clogged sink since they arrived."*
11. *"Thermogenic cells like Nitrophil have a resting body temperature that could boil an egg.// The Director calls them 'walking fire hazards' and banned them from the executive floor."*
12. *"I heard rumors from the Alpha-Beta Sector.// They're working on a 'Dual Combatant' pair called Dip-Alpha and Dip-Beta.// Apparently, they're inseparable. If one goes down, it's a disaster for everyone's energy levels."*
13. *"I saw a senior researcher trying to 'authenticate' a Bikini Card using a high-powered electron microscope.// He claimed he was checking for 'tactical watermarks,' but he hasn't blinked in three hours.// Curious dedication to the craft, really."*
14. *"Why is everyone suddenly trading 'Swimsuit Variants' of the Cell cards?// I heard the holographic foil is made of 'distilled summer vibes' and makes your Pellicle look 10% more fabulous.// I need one for... thermal testing."*
15. *"I tried to explain my research to a Lydrosome,// but it just went right over its head.// I guess I shouldn't have expected it to absorb information that quickly.// It has zero osmotic interest in my career."*
16. *"What if we synthesized a cell that only eats student loans?// We'd have to give it a very high affinity for 'depleted wallets' and 'unpaid interest'.// I think it's a Nobel Prize waiting to happen."*
17. *"Did you know that some cells in the Botanic Sector can actually hear you scream?// Well, not 'hear' in the traditional sense, but they respond to high-frequency vibrations.// So if you're having a bad day, please scream quietly.// You're stressing the ferns."*
18. *"I asked the Nitrophils if they knew any jokes about thermal dynamics.// They acts like they're too 'hot' to handle.// I really need to stop talking to the thermogenic specimens."*
19. *"I've been calculating the trajectory of a Nitrophil launched from a high-pressure bio-chute.// If we get the angle right, we could technically deliver spicy noodles across the entire lab in 0.8 seconds.// The Director's office is right in the flight path, though."*
20. *"Did you know the 'anti-slip' coating on the stairs is actually a layer of modified adhesive cells that 'lick' your shoes to keep them in place?// It works wonders, but the feeling of a thousand tiny tongues tasting your sneakers is... technically questionable.// And remarkably loud on quiet shifts."*

#### Zone: Botanic Sector (Lana's Wing)
1. *"Lana is brilliant with those Cambihils, but she has to hide them when the Director walks by.// He calls them 'invasive weeds' and says they're a disgrace to the department."*
2. *"Fun fact: Cambihils actually photosynthetic at a 15% higher efficiency rate when they're near a window.// They're basically high-speed solar panels with leaves."*
3. *"Watch out for the 'Canobolus' project in the Fungal Ward.// It’s a Ballistospore with a catapult mechanism.// They say it roots itself into the floor and just starts peppering its target with high-pressure spores like a machine gun."*
4. *"The humidity in here is great for the ferns, but it's murder on my paperwork."*
5. *"Did you see the glowing hedge move?// Lana says it's just 'bio-active curiosity', but I'm not so sure."*
6. *"Lana spends more time talking to the plants than most of us.// Can't blame her, really. At least the plants don't complain about data entry."*
7. *"Lana claims her 'Bikini Collection' is purely for 'UV radiation benchmarks'.// Right... and I'm sure that floral-pattern one is for 'camouflaging with the hydrangeas'.// She's not fooling anyone."*

#### Zone: Human Research Ward (Dyzes' Wing)
1. *"Working in Human Cell Research with Dyzes is great,// but the Lydrosomes keep trying to 'clean' my coffee mug with high-pressure jets. It's quite a messy way to start the morning."*
2. *"Viral-type cells don't actually 'infect'—they just share data at a molecular level.// The Director hates them the most;// he says they're 'biological parasites' that should have been deleted years ago."*
3. *"Sector 7 is trying to fix a 'buggy' mitochondria they're calling Mitonegy.// It’s supposed to act like a transformer, patching up colleagues' membranes automatically.// Sounds like a maintenance nightmare."*
4. *"Have you seen the blueprints for the 'Kerashell'?// It's a Keratinocyte with an armor plates made of skin protein.// They say it can take a beating with almost zero energy cost.// I wish my lab coat was that durable."*
5. *"I heard the Scavenger team in the basement is working on Chlarob.// It's based on Chlamydia, but instead of making you sick, it's programmed to thieve energy from enemy cells. Tactical, but a bit creepy."*
6. *"Micro-tactical data is coming in fast today.// Dyzes is going to be pleased with the latest Lydrosome stats."*
7. *"I asked Dyzes for a Band-Aid after a papercut.// He tried to give me a 'Lydrosome-infused regenerating patch' that cost more than my monthly salary.// I just used a napkin instead."*
8. *"Dyzes says the human-cell interface is 98% stable.// I'm just wondering about what happens with that last 2%."*

- **Environment**: Dusty, dimly lit, filled with crates and obsolete machinery.
- **The Incubator**: A single, glowing orange tank containing the **Origin Nitrophil**.
- **DataLog [L]**: Contains **Log #999** (left on the floor in the dust).

## Starter Monster: Your Bio-Signature
Upon entering the lab for your first shift, Jenzi leads you to the **Incubation Chamber** in the Lobby. To proceed with your research, you must choose a "Primary Biological Signature":

- **Cambihil** (Botanic Type): For those who value defense and steady growth.
- **Lydrosome** (Osmotic Type): For those who prefer tactical precision and long-range power.
- **Nitrophil** (Thermogenic Type): For those who favor raw offense and explosive energy. 
  *(Note: This is a 'Normal' Nitrophil born the morning after The Incident, not the hidden Origin).*


## Win Condition: The Final Confession
The game concludes through a specific sequence of investigative steps:
1.  **Preparation**: Combine the Old Lab Key, Location DataLog, and Rare Inferno Sauce.
2.  **The Extraction**: Unlock the **Old Lab Room** and secure the **Origin Nitrophil**.
3.  **The Confrontation**: Take the Origin Nitrophil directly to **Director Capsain** in the Executive Suite.

### The Climax Dialogue
**[Player presents the Origin Nitrophil]**

**Director Capsain:** *"WHAT?! Where did you... how did you find that?! That room was sealed! It was supposed to stay buried with the '82 logs! Get that... that anomaly out of my sight immediately!"*

**[Origin Nitrophil glows a hyperactive orange and vibrates happily]**

**Director Capsain:** *[Voice softens, trembling]* *"It... it still does that. Just like the night of the... 'accident'. Look at that hue. It's the exact shade of the 'Inferno' blend. I tried to tell them it was radiation. I told the board we were pioneers of bio-hazard engineering..."*

**Director Capsain:** *[He sighs deeply, sitting back]* *"Fine. You win, intern. The 'Ionization Leak' was a lie. I was working late. I was hungry. One drop of the extra-spicy sauce fell into Petri Dish #0, and... it didn't dissolve. It stood up. It looked at me. And I was too damn busy worrying about my reputation to tell the truth."*

**Director Capsain:** *"I spent years calling them 'accidents' to cover my own stupidity. But look at him. He's hyperactive, he's chill, and he's more alive than any of my 'professional' theories. The Cells aren't anomalies... they're the best mistake I ever made."*

**Director Capsain:** *[He stands up and looks out the window at the Atrium]* *"Effective immediately, I am rescinding the termination order. The 'Cell Project' will continue—officially. And I want you to be our newest Official Scientist. You have proven yourself more capable than any intern I've ever seen, and the lab needs your sharp mind."*

**Director Capsain:** *[He turns to the player with a small, weary smile]* *"Thank you. I didn't realize how heavy this secret was until you took it off my shoulders. Now, let's go tell the staff that 'Noodle Tuesdays' are officially a lab holiday."*

## Environmental Storytelling
To deepen the mystery, the lab is littered with subtle clues about the Director’s secret habits.

### Interactable: Empty Noodle Bowls
- **Location**: Found on desks, behind equipment, or near waste bins in several sectors.
- **Interaction Text**: *"An empty bowl of instant noodles. It smells faintly of vinegar and fire."* or *"A discarded noodle container. The label says 'Inferno Brand - Extra Spicy'. Red stains are visible on the rim."*
