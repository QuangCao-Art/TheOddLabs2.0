## 📖 Glossary: Key Terms
- **Cell**: Your monster/unit (e.g., Nitrophil).
- **HP (Health Points)**: Your life. If it hits 0, the mission fails.
- **PP (Pellicle Points)**: Your tactical energy. Generated by precise movement.
- **Pellicle**: A protective layer. Having PP reduces incoming damage.
- **MAP (Matching Attack Placement)**: The 5-node system used to calculate hit quality and energy gain.
- **Node**: One of the 5 positions on your tactical pentagon.

## 🎓 Tutorial: How to Play

### 1. Simultaneous Prediction
Every turn is a duel of minds. You and your opponent choose a **Node** on your respective Pentagons at same time. 

### 2. Choosing Your Move
- **Basic Skills**: Cost 0 PP. Reliable and good for building energy.
- **Pellicle Skills**: Cost stored PP. These deal heavy damage or provide tactical advantages.

### 3. The MAP Result
When the turn resolves, the game checks the "Distance" between your selected node and the opponent's choice:
- **🎯 MATCH (Dist 0)**: You chose the **Exact Same** spot. 
    - *Effect*: **1.25x Damage** and **+3 PP**.
- **📍 NEAR (Dist 1)**: You chose nodes **next to each other**. 
    - *Effect*: **1.0x Damage** and **+2 PP**.
- **🚫 FAR (Dist 2+)**: You chose positions far apart. 
    - *Effect*: **0.75x Damage** and **+1 PP**.

## ⚖️ Core Rules

### 🛡️ Turns & Defense
- Only the **Attacker** deals damage.
- When it's your **Defense Turn**, your skills swap to **Defense Moves** (like Quick Dodge or Thermo Shell).
- Use these to reflect damage or force the enemy into a "Far" result!

### ⚡ PP Overload & Recall
- **The Limit**: You can store a maximum of **10 PP**.
- **The Penalty**: If you start a turn with 10 PP, you trigger **Overload Recall**, dealing **10 HP damage** to yourself. 
- *Strategy*: Use your big skills before you hit the limit!

### 🧪 Elemental Advantage
- Every Cell has a **Type** (Thermogenic, Osmotic, Botanic, etc.).
- **Advantage**: Deals **1.5x Damage**.
- **Disadvantage**: Deals **0.75x Damage**.
- *Check the Elemental Table in the Main Menu for full details.*

### 💜 Critical Hits
- Attacks have a chance to **Critical Hit**, dealing **1.5x Damage**.
- Look for the purple damage numbers and the screen shake!

## 🚀 Pro Tips
1. **Watch the PP Bar**: Reaching 10 PP is dangerous. Always have a Pellicle skill ready to spend your energy.
2. **Predict the Logic**: Most players favor the "Top" node. Bait them by selecting the adjacent nodes for a "Near" hit!
3. **Use Defense**: Thermo Shell reflects 20% damage. Sometimes, taking a hit on purpose is the best way to win.
