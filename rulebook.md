## 📖 Glossary: Key Terms
- **Cell**: Your monster/unit (e.g., Nitrophil).
- **HP (Health Points)**: Your life. If it hits 0, the mission fails.
- **PP (Pellicle Points)**: Your tactical energy. Generated by precise movement.
- **Pellicle**: A protective layer. Having PP reduces incoming damage.
- **MAP (Matching Attack Placement)**: The 5-node system used to calculate hit quality and energy gain.
- **Node**: One of the 5 positions on your tactical pentagon.

## 🎓 Tutorial: How to Play

### 1. Simultaneous Prediction
Every turn is a duel of minds. You and your opponent choose a **Node** on your respective Pentagons at same time. 

### 2. Choosing Your Move
- **Basic Skills**: Cost 0 PP. Reliable and good for building energy.
- **Pellicle Skills**: Cost stored PP. These deal heavy damage or provide tactical advantages.

### 3. The MAP Result
When the turn resolves, the game checks the "Distance" between your selected node and the opponent's choice:
- **🎯 MATCH (Dist 0)**: You chose the **Exact Same** spot. 
    - *Effect*: **1.25x Damage** and **+3 PP**.
- **📍 NEAR (Dist 1)**: You chose nodes **next to each other**. 
    - *Effect*: **1.0x Damage** and **+2 PP**.
- **🚫 FAR (Dist 2+)**: You chose positions far apart. 
    - *Effect*: **0.75x Damage** and **+1 PP**.

- Disadvantage: **0.75x Damage**.

### 💜 Critical Hits
- Random chance for **1.5x Damage**. Significant purple flash and screen shake.

## 🚀 Pro Tips
1. **Defensive Lockdown**: Use defense moves to force a "Far" result, potentially locking nodes for the enemy attacker.
2. **Pellicle Mitigation**: Each PP point reduces incoming damage by 3. High PP makes you a tank.
