# 🧪 The Odd Labs 2.0: Official Rulebook

Welcome to the microscopic arena. This guide will teach you how to master the **Matching Attack Placement (MAP)** system and lead your Cell to victory.

## 📖 Glossary: Key Terms
- **Cell**: Your monster/unit (e.g., Nitrophil).
- **HP (Health Points)**: Your life. If it hits 0, the mission fails.
- **PP (Pellicle Points)**: Your tactical energy. Generated by precise movement.
- **Pellicle**: A protective layer. Having positive PP reduces incoming damage.
- **Lysis State**: Structural failure occurring at negative PP. Increases incoming damage.
- **MAP (Matching Attack Placement)**: The 5-node system used to calculate hit quality and energy gain.
- **Node**: One of the 5 positions on your tactical pentagon.

## 🎓 Tutorial: How to Play

### 1. Simultaneous Prediction
Every turn is a duel of minds. You and your opponent choose a **Node** on your respective Pentagons at same time. 

### 2. Choosing Your Move
- **Basic Skills**: Cost 0 PP. Reliable and good for building energy.
- **Pellicle Skills**: Cost stored PP. These deal heavy damage or provide tactical advantages.

### 3. The MAP Result
When the turn resolves, the game checks the "Distance" between your selected node and the opponent's choice:
- **🎯 MATCH (Dist 0)**: You chose the **Exact Same** spot. 
    - *Effect*: **1.25x Damage** and **+3 PP** (Basic Skills only).
- **📍 NEAR (Dist 1)**: You chose nodes **next to each other**. 
    - *Effect*: **1.0x Damage** and **+2 PP** (Basic Skills only).
- **🚫 FAR (Dist 2+)**: You chose positions far apart. 
    - *Effect*: **0.75x Damage** and **+1 PP** (Basic Skills only).

## ⚖️ Core Rules

### 🛡️ Turns & Defense
- Only the **Attacker** deals damage.
- When it's your **Defense Turn**, your skills swap to **Defense Moves**.

### ⚡ PP Overload (Pellicle Discharge)
- **The Limit**: Maximum of **10 PP**.
- **The Penalty**: Starting a turn with 10 PP triggers a **Pellicle Discharge**, dealing **30 HP damage** and discharging all PP. 

### 🧪 Lysis State (Structural Failure)
- **The Debt**: You can use Pellicle Skills even if you have 0 PP, over-exerting your cell into negative values (up to **-10 PP**).
- **The Penalty**: While in Lysis (Negative PP), incoming damage is **increased**.
- **The Scale**: Each point of negative PP adds **+3 HP damage** per hit.
- **UI**: The PP bar turns **Orangish-Red** and floating damage displays a ⚡ broken shield icon.

### 🧪 Elemental Advantage
- Advantage (e.g., Thermogenic vs Botanic): **1.5x Damage**.
- Disadvantage: **0.75x Damage**.

### 💜 Critical Hits
- Random chance for **1.5x Damage**. Significant purple flash and screen shake.

## 🎴 C-CARD Catalyst (Progression)
The Linear "Bio-Growth" model has been replaced by the **Catalyst Enhance Machine**.

### 1. The C-CARD System
- **Tiers**: 
    - **Tier 1 (Bronze)**: Basic stat adaptations.
    - **Tier 2 (Cyan)**: Advanced stats + **1 Expansion Slot**.
    - **Tier 3 (Purple)**: Elite adaptations + **2 Expansion Slots**.
- **Equip Rule**: A Cell cannot equip two cards of the same ID (e.g., two "ATK Adaptor +5").
- **Slot Limit**: Maximum of **10 slots** per Cell.
- **Recursive Removal**: Removing a card that provides expansion slots will automatically unequip all "child" cards in those slots.

### 2. Leader Perks (Squad-Wide)
Progressing through levels (Lvl 1-15) unlocks permanent squad bonuses:
- **Lvl 5 (2nd Core)**: Unlocks the 2nd attack and defense skill slots.
- **Lvl 10 (3rd Core)**: Unlocks the 3rd attack and defense skill slots.
- **Lvl 15 (Burst Protocol)**: First attack of every battle deals **2.0x Damage**.

## 🚀 Pro Tips
1. **Defensive Lockdown**: Use defense moves to force a "Far" result, potentially locking nodes for the enemy attacker.
2. **Pellicle Mitigation**: Each PP point reduces incoming damage by 3. High PP makes you a tank.
3. **Strategic Branching**: Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 cards in early slots to open up massive branch networks for more stat cards.
