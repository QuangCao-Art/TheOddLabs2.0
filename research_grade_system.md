## Leader Card Effects

Leader cards are **Passive**. Having them in the `cardBox` unlocks specific tactical advantages.

| **The Third Brain** | **Passive** (Box) | Unlocks 2nd Pellicle Attack/Defense skills (Index 2). |
| **Oxidative Energy Burst** | **Equipped** (Slot) | **Overload Alpha**: First hit of the battle deals x2 Damage. |
| **Neural Initiative** | **Equipped** (Slot) | **Initiative Zero**: Always go first regardless of Speed. |
| **Molecular Dissolver** | **Equipped** (Slot) | **Hyper-Enzyme**: Damage ignores opponent Defense. |

🧠 Tactical Skill Unlocking
I've clarified the Leader Brain descriptions to ensure the mapping is clear:

The Second Brain: Unlocks the 1st Pellicle slot (the 2nd move in your list).
The Third Brain: Unlocks the 2nd Pellicle slot (the 3rd move in your list).
The basic 1st move is always ready for combat.
